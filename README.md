# 16-bit CARRY SELECT ADDER 

Adders are basic building blocks of any processor or data path application. For the design of high-performance processing units high speed adders with low power consumption is a requirement. Carry Select Adder (CSA) is known to be one of the fastest adders used in many data processing applications. In this project, we present a new CSLA architecture using NAND gates alone. It employs multiplexers and full-adders for calculation of sum and carry of two 16-bit numbers.

## DESCRIPTION
Using the basic gates the 16-bit carry select adder is built. The carry selecte adder is built using HDL and its working is simulated in Hardware Simulator of nand2tetris software. Detailed working and simulation is attached as a report.

## USAGE
Download this software from nand2tetris.
